# Data and Algorithm Flow

| **Step**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Collection               | Gather all necessary data including teacher availability, room availability, and subject requirements.                                 |
| Initial Population Generation | Create an initial set of possible timetables (population).                                                                             |
| Fitness Evaluation            | Evaluate each timetable based on predefined criteria such as teacher conflicts, room conflicts, and adherence to subject requirements. |
| Selection                     | Select the best-performing timetables to serve as parents for the next generation.                                                     |
| Crossover and Mutation        | Generate new timetables by combining parts of the selected parents and introducing small random changes (mutations).                   |
| Iteration                     | Repeat the evaluation, selection, and crossover/mutation steps for several generations until an optimal timetable is found.            |
| Final Timetable               | Select the best timetable from the final generation as the solution.                                                                   |

___This process ensures that the generated timetable is optimized for the given constraints and requirements.___
